        <div id="panel">Photography is the process of recording an image, photograph, or a lightsemstove film. <br>With it, we can keep and perserve the membories of our loved one. <br>It was invented in 1826 or 1827, where the first photograph was made, and was made by NicÃ©phore NiÃ©pce, Frederick Scott Archer, and Felix Benedict Herzog.</br> Photography is important because it lets us document something and keep it forever while also expressing our ideas for others to see.<br> Photography and taking images is a universal language that speakes to the heart.<br><strong><u> FUN FACT</u></strong><br> Did you know that cat photos are so much older than you think? <br> In 1870s Harry Pointer took a picture of his cat and it is one of the most popular searches in Google.</div>

                    <h4><strong>Software</strong></h4>
                    <p>For photography, software is used to help edit photos that were taken to make the photos look more professional or appealing. Some examples of softwares that photography use would be:</p>
                    <h5>Adobe	 Lightroom</h5>
                    <p>Adobe Lightroom is a software that photographers use to make changes to a photo without permanently changing the photo.</p>
                    <img src="img/adobe-lightroom.jpg" class="software">
                    <h5>Photoshop CC</h5>
                    <p>Photoshop CC is used for itâ€™s editing software which makes photos look more modernized with upgraded tools and it can access Lightroom photos.</p>
                    <img src="img/photoshop-cc.jpg" class="software">
                    <h5>Affinity Photo</h5>
                    <p>Affinity Photo is a software that is easy to learn and master with a low and affordable cost.</p>
                    <img src="img/affinity-photo.jpg" class="software">
                    <h4><strong>Hardware</strong></h4>
                    <p>Hardware is used to operate photography, more similar to how we use our bodies to operate ourselves.</p>
                    <h5>Camera</h5>
                    <p>Camera is an essential hardware for photography as it is used to take all the pictures people see across the world.</p>
                    <img src="img/hardware-camera.jpg" class="hardware">
                    <h5>Hard drive</h5>
                    <p>Hard drive is used to store the pictures that were taken as digital content.</p>
                    <img src="img/hardware-hard-drive.jpg" class="hardware">
                    <h5>Storage chip</h5>
                    <p>Storage chip is used to store data until it is purposely erased. With it, images can be saved inside the chip to carry around.

                    <h2 id="part-b"><strong>Future Invention Ideas</strong></h2>
                    <h5><strong>A. Camera glasses</strong></h5>
                    <p>We planned to do a future idea that can help improve photography.<br> It is a pair of glasses but works like a camera with phone functions.<br> There would be a miniature button somewhere at the glasses that when pressed could take a picture of whatever you're seeing and transfer it to your phone, desktop/laptop and tablet for editing purposes. <br> It would have better lenses to make the image look clearer, better lighting to look more presentable, and is both portable and waterproof.<br> It would also use solar and electric energy while catching memorable moments in a convenient and faster way than pulling out your phone.</p>
                    <img src="img/camera-glasses.jpg" class="invention">
                    <h5><strong>B. Pop up pictures (hologram)</strong></h5>
                    <p>Another idea we planned to do is another future idea that can help improve photography even more is a pop up picture when editing them (aka hologram).<br> It works the same exact way as you can take pictures on a phone (one button).<br> Can be used underwater and take pictures live with more details than the normal camera. Has better editing qualities, and it is like in mid air.<br> Also, when looking at the photo, it would be presented as a 3d photo.<br></p>
                    <img src="img/hologram.jpg" class="invention">
                    <h5><strong>C. Full Frame Smartphone Sensor</strong></h5>
                    <p>Our last idea is the Full Frame Smartphone Senors, this idea can help improve photography so much.<br> Our smartphones don't cover the whole image that we are seeig but on the other hand cameras do, we can make a full frame camera to attach to the smartphone.<br> This would be perfect for photographer because photographers needa bring their big camera, which can take up to a lot of space.<br> The Full Frame Smartphone Senors is a good idea because it is convient for photographers, it also give them a chance it take pictures without bringing a camera.<br></p>
